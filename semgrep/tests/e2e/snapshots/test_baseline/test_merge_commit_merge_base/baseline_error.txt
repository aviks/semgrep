  Current version has 2 findings.

Switching repository to baseline commit 'baseline-commit'.
  Will report findings introduced by these commits:
    * 4e933ff commit #1
  The current branch is missing these commits from the baseline branch:
    * 10a1819 commit #2
  Any finding these commits fixed will look like a new finding in the current branch.
  To avoid reporting such findings, compare to the branch-off point with:
    --baseline-commit=$(git merge-base baseline-commit HEAD)
