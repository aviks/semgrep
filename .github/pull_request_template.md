PR checklist:

- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Changelog is up-to-date
- [ ] Changelog includes:
  - A reference to a Linear ticket - if no linear ticket is associated, a reference to a GitHub issue number or a semantic name, for example, `gh1234.added` or `logoutput.fixed` is appropriate.
  - Changlog entry file is named appropriately - for example, `cli-123.added`, `pa-321.fixed`, `gh-1234.changed` or `release-process.infra`
  - What was changed
  - Why the change was made
  - How the change/design changes were made
- [ ] Change has no security implications (otherwise, ping security team)
